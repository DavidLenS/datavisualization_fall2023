# ggparliament: plots of parliaments

The ggparliament package is a ggplot2 extension and enables plots of a parliament's composition (seats by party). You can find the vignette here:https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggparliament/vignettes/basic-parliament-plots_1.html.A data frame containing party name and number of seats is required as input.

```{r build data frame}
# we create our "custom" dataframe based on the seat distribution in the German Bundestag for 2017 and 2021

# first, for 2017:
# we store a vector mit party names in the object "party2017"
party2017 <- c("CDU/CSU", "SPD", "AfD", "FDP", "LINKE", "GRUNE")

# next, we store a vector with the respective number of seats in the object "seats2017"
seats2017 <- c(246,153,94,80,69,67)

# finally, we store a vector with the respective party colors in the object "colour2017"
colour2017 <- c("#000000", "#EB001F","#009EE0", "#FFED00", "#BE3075", "#64A12D")

# now, we can use the data.frame() function to create our data frame
germany_election_data_2017 <- data.frame(party2017, seats2017, colour2017)


# we repeat the same process for 2021, but update parties, seats and colours
party2021 <- c("SPD", "CDU/CSU","GrÃ¼ne", "FDP", "AfD", "Linke", "SSW")
seats2021 <- c(206,196,118,92,83,39,1)
colour2021 <- c("#EB001F", "#000000","#64A12D", "#FFED00", "#009EE0", "#BE3075", "#000088")


germany_election_data_2021 <- data.frame(party2021, seats2021, colour2021)
```


```{r bundestag 2017}
#2017

# using the parliament_data() function from the ggparliament package, we create the object to be plotted:

  # rows in parliament

  # shape of parliament
  type = "semicircle",
  # provide the function the column containing the number of seats
  party_seats = germany_election_data_2017$seats2017)

# now we can plot, here we store the ggplot as an object in "bundestag2017"
bundestag2017 <- ggplot(germany2017,  #data
                        aes(x,
