## **Course description**

**\
**The course introduces students to data visualization techniques for
comparative politics taking a very practical approach using the R
programming language. At the beginning of the course, you will be guided
into the programming language by learning the basics of data management,
generating summary statistics, and simple visualizations. On this basis,
we will then deal with large quantities of data -- covering temporal,
spatial, and relational dimensions -- and more complex data
visualizations such as maps, interactive plots, or GIFs.

The goal of this course is to equip the students with the necessary
skills to collect (large quantities of) data, clean data sets, explore
and understand patterns of data, and communicate these patterns and
findings with visualizations. In addition, learning to produce effective
graphs from own data is a great way to a better understanding of graphs
-- as well as their strengths or shortcomings -- presented in research
journals or the media.

## **Seminar goals**

This course equips you with the necessary skills

-   to process large quantities of data

-   to clean and arrange datasets

-   to explore and understand patterns of data

-   to communicate these patterns and findings

-   to understand and question critically visualizations in research
    articles and the media

## **Prerequisites**

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with R.

## **Course requirements**

**Active participation and preparation:**

Attending the weekly sessions and reading assigned articles and chapters
before class. Use Slack to post any questions or discuss with your peers
if you do not understand concepts. Usually, I post questions to think
about regarding the readings. Keep them in mind while reading.

**Mandatory exercises**

Throughout the semester, I will assign you small exercises. The goal is
to produce anything from simple plots to advanced graphics and to
demonstrate that you can apply the concepts presented in the seminar.

**Visualization project (100% of your grade):**

Creation of multiple visualizations of (political) data. While it is
possible to produce static visualizations and hand in a PDF, ideally the
visualizations are part of an interactive (web) dashboard. The
visualization project has to be submitted via ILIAS. Late submissions
will result in deductions of 1/3 of a grade point per day. **In case of
any questions or problems, please get in touch with me early.**

**Deadline:** January 18, 2024, 23:59.

## Content

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Your final project should relate to a research question broadly
    related to political science and comparative politics.

-   First, you should describe the motivation for your visualization
    project.

-   Second, make a theoretical argument for the relationships you are
    investigating.

-   Third, describe the data source.

-   Fourth, annotate your coding (import, transformation, ...)
    extensively.
:::

## Quantity

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   It is difficult to determine a exact "number of plots" needed. Of
    course, you can display much more information in an interactive
    Shiny app than in a static dashboard.

-   You should produce *enough* plots (visualizations) to effectively
    address your research question. Description is totally fine!

-   Note: This is also where the individual office hour comes into play!
:::

## Quality

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   We have spoken a lot about how we can produce elegant graphs.

-   Therefore, the design of the visualizations will make up a
    considerable share of your grade.

-   Remember? **C**ontrast, **R**epetition, **A**lignment,
    and **P**roximity

-   Creating your own theme!

-   All the *little* things: Titles, captions, accompanying text,
    colors, different aesthetics, ...

-   Here, there is clearly potential for bonus points for effort.

## **Organization & Learning Resources**

**Course website, Slack, and ILIAS:**

The plan is to use primarily the course website and Slack for providing
the structure of the seminar and communication, respectively.
Nevertheless, you will also receive mails via ILIAS. Make sure to
regularly check your university e-mail address.

-   You can find the course website here:
    [Link](https://datavisualizationfall2023.netlify.app/ "https://datavisualizationfall2023.netlify.app/")

-   The ILIAS seminar name is: Ü Methoden der Vergleichenden
    Regierungslehre: Data Visualization for Comparative Politics \[WÜB\]
    \[1. PG\] (HWS 2023). Ensure that you have access to the system and
    that e-mails sent over ILIAS are forwarded to the e-mail account you
    check regularly.

-   If you have contacted me with a question via any channel and you did
    not hear back after 2 days (except over the weekend), please just
    send me your question again!

**Office hours:**

-   In-person (A 340) or via Zoom, Thu 15:30 -- 16:30, please make an
    appointment by e-mail.

-   If you have a specific question or problem (e.g., finding a research
    question), please tell me before coming to the office hours (when
    making the appointment). This way , I can also prepare for it and
    thereby making our meeting more productive and constructive.

**Covid-19 (and general illness):**

-   If you feel ill or have symptoms, please be considerate of your
    fellow students and yourself(!). Just let me know by e-mail.

**Students with disabilities or chronic illnesses:**

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need
    special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.

-   And please do this early in the semester so that we can make the
    appropriate arrangements immediately.

**If you need support:**

Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable
with the question. It is important to note that the [University's
Equality and Diversity
Office](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gleichstellung/beratung/) supports
and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual harassment. The
responsible contact person in such a case is Dipl.-Psych. Ute Pfründer.
She is trained to deal with such incidents and will keep everything
strictly confidential. No action will be taken without your express
consent. Further counseling services offered by the university can be
found via this
