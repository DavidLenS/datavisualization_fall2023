## Plan for Today

-   Dataquest access

-   Discuss readings & short input *\~ 30 min*

-   Group work: Case studies *\~ 30 min*

    -   Economic \| social \| political impact?

    -   Pathways?

    -   Adaptation gap?

-   Short presentations & discussions *\~ 30 min*

-   Outlook next week

## Dataquest

-   Free access to premium team account until 01.08.2023

-   Possibility to learn R (but also Python, Excel, etc.)

-   The Dataquest catalog includes:

    -   Career paths (e.g., Data Analyst in R)

    -   Skill paths (e.g., Probability and Statistics with R)

    -   Individual courses (e.g., Linear Regression Modeling in R)

-   Invitation to team account after the session

# Readings - Your Key Takeaways?

## Readings - Discussion Questions

-   Consequences of the differentiated impacts of climate change?

    -   Gender, Income, Resources

-   Examples of good adaptation, failure to adapt? What about mitigation?

-   Did reading the two texts make you more or less pessimistic about the future?

-   We read about economics, but what role can political science play as a discipline?

## Climate âŸ¶ Social Outcomes

## Pathways

**Direct**

-   Change in distribution of weather leads to change in distribution of events experienced by individuals

**Informational**

-   Individuals expect specific distributions of weather events and their effects

## Example: Profanity on Social Media

## Adaptation Gaps

## Group Work: Case Studies (1)

**Task**

Prepare a short presentation (max. 5 mins - 1 slide per question) addressing the following questions (choose specific scenarios!)

-   What kind of impact (economic, social, political) does climate change have for *your* country?

-   Describe possible pathways

-   Are there adaptation gaps?

## Group Work: Case Studies (2)

**Countries**

-   Bangladesh

-   Brazil

-   Ethiopia

-   Germany

-   United Kingdom

## Group Work: Case Studies (3)

Your turn! Country profiles are available on ILIAS. Of course, you can look for additional information.

## Presentations

**Order**

1.  Bangladesh

2.  Brazil

3.  Ethiopia

4.  Germany

## (Until) Next Week

**Climate Change as Collective Action Problem?**

-   Add comments, discussion questions, etc. for the mandatory readings. Try Perusall:

    -   Aklin, M., & Mildenberger, M. (2020)

    -   Breetz, H., Mildenberger, M., & Stokes, L. (2018)

-   We will expand our case studies: What are possible solutions? How can we achieve them?
