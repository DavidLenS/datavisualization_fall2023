#### Pathways

**Direct**

-   Change in distribution of weather leads to change in distribution of events experienced by individuals

**Informational**

-   Individuals expect specific distributions of weather events and their effects

## Aklin & Mildenberger

. . .

-   Collective action theory: Incentives for free-riding need to be overcome by international cooperation

-   But states do not seem to follow this logic. Rather: Climate outcomes vs. policies

    -   Policies are shaped by political competition

-   Distributive conflict as main constraint for policy-making

-   Successful international agreements: Strengthen pro-climate groups & neutralize veto players

## Breetz et al. (1)

. . .

-   Energy transitions are characterized by prices and quantities

    -   Relationship between these factors: *Experience* or *learning curves*

-   But: Policy and politics not taken into account

    -   Affects both price and quantity

    -   Effects differ depending on current stage of the experience curve

## Discussion Questions

-   Energy transition in Europe / Germany? Possible to neutralize fossil fuel interests, when COP28 is being held in an oil rich country?

-   What role does Germany play in terms of climate protection compared to pivotal players (per capita)? Is Germany even a pivotal player? Can climate agreements be enforced? Monitoring & "punishment"

-   US exceptionalism? "For me the large fraction of the US population who supports climate action regardless of what other countries do is surprising."

## Group Work: Last Week

**Task**

Prepare a short presentation (max. 5 mins - 1 slide per question) addressing the following questions (choose specific scenarios!)

-   What kind of impact (economic, social, political) does climate change have for *your* country?

-   Describe possible pathways

-   Are there adaptation gaps?

## Group Work: Case Studies (1)

**Task**

Prepare a short presentation (max. 5 mins - 2-3 slides) addressing the following questions for your case study of last week:

-   Distributive conflict vs. collective action?

-   How to overcome?

## Group Work: Case Studies (2)

Your turn!

-   Country profiles are available on ILIAS. Of course, you can look for additional information.

-   Please send me your presentations via e-mail.
