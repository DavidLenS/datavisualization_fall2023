## Presentation 1

-   Diffenbaugh, N. S., & Burke, M. (2019). Global warming has increased global economic inequality. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116(20), 9808-9813.

## Discussion - Individual Thinking

-   Is it problematic that some regions might benefit from climate change? What about short-, medium- and long-term perspectives?

```{r countdown-package, include=FALSE}
#remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/countdown")
library(countdown)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 30, 
          left = 0, right = 0,
          padding = "25px",
          margin = "5%",
          font_size = "3em",
          #color_border = solarized$magenta,
          color_text = "#000",
          color_running_background  = "#f0f1eb",
          #color_running_text        = solarized$base02,
          color_finished_background = "#f0f1eb")
          #color_finished_text       = solarized$base3)
```

## Discussion - In Groups

-   Is it problematic that some regions might benefit from climate change? What about short-, medium- and long-term perspectives?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3, seconds = 00, 
          left = 0, right = 0,
          padding = "25px",
          margin = "5%",
          font_size = "3em",
          #color_border = solarized$magenta,
          color_text = "#000",
          color_running_background  = "#f0f1eb",
          #color_running_text        = solarized$base02,
          color_finished_background = "#f0f1eb")
          #color_finished_text       = solarized$base3)
```

## Presentation 2

-   Hartzell‐Nichols, L. (2011). Responsibility for meeting the costs of adaptation. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 2(5), 687-700.

## Discussion - Individual Thinking

-   ... those who are least responsible for climate change will suffer the most. How can the responsibility for financing climate change adaptation measures be equitably distributed among different actors?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 30, 
          left = 0, right = 0,
          padding = "25px",
          margin = "5%",
          font_size = "3em",
          #color_border = solarized$magenta,
          color_text = "#000",
          color_running_background  = "#f0f1eb",
          #color_running_text        = solarized$base02,
          color_finished_background = "#f0f1eb")
          #color_finished_text       = solarized$base3)
```

# Recap - Elements of a Research Design

## Literature (Access with Katolog Primo)

-   King, G., Keohane, R. O., and Verba , S. (1994). Designing Social Inquiry: Scientific Inference in Qualitative Research. Princeton: Princeton University Press \| Chapter 1.

-   Powner, L. C. (2015). Empirical Research and Writing: A Political Science Student's Practical Guide. Los Angeles: Sage \| Chapter 1 + 2

## Research Process

-   Defining your research question

-   Specifying concepts & theory

-   Operationalization and measurement

-   Selecting your case

-   *Descriptive & causal inference*

-   *Drawing conclusions*

## Research Question

What makes a good research question?

. . .

-   Scientific relevance: Knowing the literature and making a contribution (research gap)

-   Societal relevance: Addressing an important real-world problem.

-   Feasability: Being specific and realistic. A term paper has a much smaller scope than a book.

## Research Question

More formal:

-   Try to avoid X-centric research questions: **X -\> ?**

    -   e.g., what are the consequences of climate change?

-   Y-centric is better: **? -\> Y**

    -   e.g., what factors drive voting behavior?

-   X-Y-centric is best: **X -\> Y**

    -   How does climate change affect voting behavior?

## Exercise: Evaluating Research Questions:

-   How does a midterm recession affect presidential economic policy?

. . .

-   What are the consequences of natural disasters?

. . .

-   Why does the political left become social democratic in some Latin American countries and populist in others?

. . .

-   How does climate change affect society?

## Research Question - Strategies

Rely on existing research:

-   Apply an existing theory to new data or cases

    -   e.g., two-party -\> multi-party systems?

-   Test existing hypothesis with new data or cases

    -   Is there a reason to expect different results?

-   Add a new dimension, new independent variable

## Concepts

-   **Term:** The concept's name

-   **Intension:** The concept's attributes (meaning)

-   **Extension:** The concept's empirical scope (operationalization)

. . .

-   **Term:** Social status

. . .

-   **Intension:** Subjective, Objective

-   **Extension:** (Objective): Education, Income, ...

## Theory

. . .

" \[...\] proposes an answer to the research question and tells why that answer is expected by specifying a mechanism, some chain of events or reactions or changes, that connects the independent (cause) variable(s) with the dependent (outcome) variable." (Powner 2015, p.22)

## Theory: Expectation

-   What do you expect? Basically a short answer of your research question.

-   You will usually already have a first version of this in mind when you formulate your research question

## Theory: Causal Mechanism

-   Why does X cause Y?

-   What intermediate steps that a change in the independent variable leads to a change in the dependent variable?

-   Different mechanisms can lead to the same results!

## Theory: Assumptions

-   Assumptions about how the world works that must be true for your theory to work

-   Most of the time this is implicit. Make it explicit!

    -   e.g., rational actors. What might we overlook?

-   Often too simplistic, but necessary to explore complex issues

-   You do not check these assumptions in your work!

## Theory: Conditions

-   For which cases do you think your theory should apply? And why?

    -   What is the difference between cases and observations?

-   For example:

    If you do comparative research on European politics, it almost always makes almost always little sense to compare systems before or during the 2. WW. The conditions are too different.

## Coleman's Bathtub: Example

![Coleman's bathtub. Example adapted from Plümper (2012, p.38)](coleman_example.jpg)

## Coleman's Bathtub: Your Turn

-   Can you can up with your own example?

## From Theory to Hypotheses

-   You should derive hypotheses from your theory!

    -   Patterns (extensions of a concept) that should apply if your theory is correct

-   Probabilistic hypotheses: The more/higher/etc. ..., the more/less/...

    -   E.g., The higher the number of natural disasters, the higher the vote share of the Greens

## From Theory to Hypotheses

-   Veto player theory (Tsebelis , 1995): The possibility of policy change depends on the number of players and their ideological position. Possible hypotheses?

. . .

-   H1: The more coalition partners there are in the government, the less likely becomes policy change

-   H2: The more ideologically distant coalition partners are, the less likely a policy change will be

-   H3: Policy change is less likely in federal systems than in unitary systems
