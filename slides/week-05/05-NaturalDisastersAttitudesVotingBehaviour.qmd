    -   Importing data in R or Stata

    -   (Generating a first data set)

# Research Proposal

## Research Proposal - General

-   Developing your research question for the final term paper

    -   It gives the motivation for your research question

    -   ... and presents a short (preliminary) overview of related literature,

    -   .... which can already lead to hypotheses.

-   Term paper can be based on your proposal but does not have to.

-   Chance of early feedback in the semester

## Research Proposal - Feedback

-   If you opt for the research proposal, then you have to review (two) proposals of your peers

-   Double-Blind-Review: Reviewer and author are "anonymous"

-   Benefits of reviewing:

    -   Chance to see what others are working on

    -   Learning how to give constructive feedback

-   You will get a checklist what to consider when reviewing a research proposal

## Research Proposal - Formal

-   Length: 700 -- 800 words (excluding references, +/- 10% , 12pt font - Times New Roman or Calibri, and 1.5 line spacing)

-   Can be written in English or German.

-   Submission of Research Proposal as PDF via ILIAS. **Deadline: April 18, 2023, 20:00**

-   Submission of Feedback as PDF via ILIAS. **Deadline: May 02, 2023, 20:00**

-   Let me know by **March 28** if you want to opt in!

# Presentations

## Presentations - General

-   Short group presentations (max. 10-12 minutes, 2-3 people)

-   Choose one of the papers of the mandatory or additional readings in the sessions after the Easter Break.

-   \~2 presentations per session

## Paper selection for presentation

Please indicate your preferences [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o9_mNOUgjVo8BTL0NOycDaNBBKsW4eFoXBtBbylBsPE/edit?usp=sharing) until next week!
:::

## Presentations - General

-   Brief, concise presentation of the literature; critical discussion of further literature and own reflections.

-   Think about the following when presenting:

    -   Arguments in the literature

    -   Alternative viewpoints and critique?

    -   Own assessment of the problem

    -   Answer to the question(s) of the paper

-   More detailed checklist on the course website and ILIAS

# Last Week

## Climate Change & Public Opinion

::: panel-tabset
## Gender

-   Gender gap in wealthy but not in poor countries

    -   Men tend to attach greater material costs to mitigation

    -   Men tend to express more support for group-based dominance (correlated with climate skepticism)

-   Implications

    -   Women's greater role in climate policy may lead to more decisive climate action

## Predictors

-   Predictors of public climate change awareness:

    -   Educational attainment

-   Predictors of climate risk perception:

    -   Understanding the anthropogenic cause of climate change (Europe, Latin America)

    -   Perception of local temperature change (Africa, Asia)

# Readings

## Discussion Mandatory Readings

-   Who wrote the article? What's their background?

-   General summary of the article

-   Strengths & Weaknesses

-   How does it connect to other readings?

-   How does it connect to current events?

-   What do you take away for your own research agenda?

## Discussion Questions

-   What role does the media coverage play?

-   Why have such events only short-lived effects (for nationwide salience)? What about less "sudden" events?

-   Did the green party not manage to capitalize of a topic that is basically their domain? Climate issue as "second-order" issue?

-   Do natural disaster increase the vote share in favor of the parties with environmental purposes in other countries? Is there something such as a threshold?
