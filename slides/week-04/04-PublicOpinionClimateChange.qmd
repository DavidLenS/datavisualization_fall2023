## Plan for Today

-   Concepts so far & Discussion of readings \~ 25 min

-   First research question \~ 45 min

    -   Research question / puzzle?

    -   Literature?

    -   Data?

-   Discussion of research questions \~ 20 min

-   Outlook next week

## Mechanisms, Dilemmata, Politics

::: panel-tabset
#### Pathways

**Direct**

-   Change in distribution of weather leads to change in distribution of events experienced by individuals

**Informational**

-   Individuals expect specific distributions of weather events and their effects

#### Dilemmata

**Collective action theory:**

-   Incentives for free-riding need to be overcome by international cooperation

**Distributive conflict:**

-   Climate policies ⤍ New economic winners and losers
-   Conflicts over material benefits, reinforced by (ideological) political struggles

#### Energy transition

*Experience* or *learning curves:* Often, policy and politics not taken into account

-   Affects both price and quantity
-   Effects differ depending on current stage of the experience curve

## Quiz

Respondents in Germany were asked: \[...\] *what percentage of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening?* What is their average estimate?

## Quiz

Respondents in Germany were asked whether they think that *oil companies are hiding technology that could make cars run without petrol or diesel*. How many think this is the case?

## Quiz

Respondents in Germany were asked when, if ever, they think *climate change will start to harm them personally*. How many think it already harms them or in the next ten years?

## Bush & Clayton

. . .

-   Gender gap in wealthy but not in poor countries

    -   Men tend to attach greater material costs to mitigation

    -   Men tend to express more support for group-based dominance (correlated with climate skepticism)

-   Implications

    -   Women's greater role in climate policy may lead to more decisive climate action

    -   Voices and perspectives from the Global South need to be considered

## Lee et al.

. . .

-   Predictors of public climate change awareness:

    -   Educational attainment

-   Predictors of climate risk perception:

    -   Understanding the anthropogenic cause of climate change (Europe, Latin America)

    -   Perception of local temperature change (Africa, Asia)

Improving education, climate literacy, and understanding of the local impacts are essential for more support for climate action - *exact strategy depends on country (context)*.

## Discussion Questions

-   Would female politicians (head of states) implement more progressive climate change mitigation policy?

-   Educational attainment as the strongest predictor of climate awareness. Climate skeptics just uneducated?

-   How could climate education look like? What should we teach over one school year, for example? Climate education as a political issue?

-   What role do social media / modern communication and globalization play? How do they foster the influence of right-wing populist / climate change denying parties?

## Finding a Research Question

**Task**

In small groups or individually, find a research question that you could also follow-up with your term paper.

-   Academic relevance?

-   Societal relevance?

-   Feasibility?

-   Relation to existing theories?

Formulate the question with a question mark!

## Finding Literature

**Helpful tools**

-   Elicit [Link](https://elicit.org/)
-   Research Rabbit [Link](https://researchrabbitapp.com/home)
-   Connected Papers [Link](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)

## Finding Data

**Task**

In small groups or individually, find possible data sources for answering your research question.

-   Easily accessible?

-   What kind of data? E.g., cross-sectional, panel data?

-   What concepts can you measure with these data?

## Your Turn!

If you have absolutely no idea where to start:

-   Have a look at the surveys, anything interesting there?

-   Recent, climate change-related events? Reporting in newspapers, etc.

```{r countdown-package, include=FALSE}
#remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/countdown")
library(countdown)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 45, seconds = 00, 
          left = 0, right = 0,
          padding = "25px",
          margin = "5%",
          font_size = "5em",
          #color_border = solarized$magenta,
          color_text = "#000",
          color_running_background  = "#f0f1eb",
          #color_running_text        = solarized$base02,
          color_finished_background = "#f0f1eb")
          #color_finished_text       = solarized$base3)
```

# Discussion of Research Questions

## (Until) Next Week

-   BLOCK II - Political Behaviour (2): Natural Disasters, Climate Attitudes and Voting Behaviour. Add comments, discussion questions, etc. for the mandatory readings. Try Perusall:
