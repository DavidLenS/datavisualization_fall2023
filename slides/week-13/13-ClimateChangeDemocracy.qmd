# Recap - Elements of a Research Design

## From Last Week

-   **Concept:** Inequality (Term). What about its intension and extension?

. . .


-   **Intension:** E.g., unequal distribution of resources within a society.

-   **Extension:** Income inequality, educational inequality, gender inequality, ...

## Extension: Arrow Diagram

![Arrow diagram. Example adapted from Plümper (2012, p.100)](arrow_diagram.jpg)

## Extension: Arrow Diagram

Based on the arrow diagram, we can formulate four expectations (empirically testable hypothesis?):

. . .

1.  Democracy lowers the probability of political instability because...

2.  Trade lowers the probability of political instability because...

3.  Infant mortality (poverty, income inequality...) increases the probability of political instability because...

4.  Political instability (state failure) leads to the outbreak of ethnic conflicts because...

## Data Collection

-   Own data collection is not feasible for this term paper (w/o advanced knowledge of R/Stata and text analysis), therefore:

    -   Rely on existing data sources (e.g., GLES, ESS, ParlGov, The PopuList, Eurostat, ...)

    -   Rely on replication material of published articles

-   Make it clear what data you use!

## Operationalization

-   **First step:** Define concepts before beginning with the operationalization!

    -   E.g., democracy: procedural democracy (Schumpeter, 1947), embedded democracy (Merkel, 2004), ...

-   **Next step:** Identify indicators to measure variables that match your theoretical concept.

. . .

-   **Task:** Identify indicators to measure procedural democracy and embedded democracy using the V-Dem data set.

## Case Selection

Consider scientific criteria while being pragmatic (see Plümber, 2012, p.80f):

-   Cost of data collection

-   Variation in the DV or main IV

-   Generalizability: What can we learn about other cases?

-   Outlier character

-   ...

Try to give several reasons for your selection!

## Case Selection: Example

*Otteni, C., & Weisskircher, M. (2022). Global warming and polarization. Wind turbines and the electoral success of the greens and the populist radical right.*

Why is the case of Germany a "good" case?

. . .

-   Global warming and wind energy -\> salient issues.

-   Expansion of wind power is main part of 'energy transition' (Energiewende)

-   Pro: Strong German Green party. Contra: Strong radical right (AfD, Alternative for Germany).

## Drafting a Term Paper

Learning to write:

-   Sports metaphor: It is important to know the rules of the game, however, you have to learn from others and try it out yourself to get better!

    -   Very good journals: APSR, AJPS, JOP, BJPS.

-   Writing != Writing

    -   Writing as preparation: Taking notes, structure paper with headings and bullet points, ...

    -   Actual writing process: Putting it all together.

## Structuring paper

![Can be adapted!](writing_structure.jpg)

## Structuring a paper

-   Give the individual sections (especially the literature discussion and theory) more meaningful titles:

    -   E.g. Slothuus, R., & Bisgaard, M. (2021). How political parties shape public opinion in the real world.

    -   *Literature discussion: Party Influence in Experimental and Real-World Settings.*

-   Adding subsections make often sense. Try to find a balance, no subsection for each paragraph.

## What order?

Do not write in the same order as in the paper! Instead:

. . .

-   Theory

-   Research Design & Analysis

-   Literature section

-   Conclusion

-   Introduction

Important: Switch between the different sections. Do not finish them separately.

## Theory

Main components:

-   Expectations

-   Causal mechanism

-   Hypothesis(es)

Quality criteria of a good theory section:

-   Innovative, but: "standing on the shoulders of giants".

-   Convincing and consistent: developing the argument step by step

## Structuring Theory - Suggestion

1.  Recapitulation of the argument

2.  The intuition of the argument

3.  Assumptions of the argument

4.  Justification of the main causal relationship

    1.  Now (or possibly after 5.) the hypotheses are stated

5.  Justification of the individual mediating causal relations

6.  Stylized facts that support the argument

## Research Design

Description of how you will test your hypotheses:

-   Operationalization and measurement of variables

    -   Dependent variable

    -   Independent variable(s)

    -   Control variables

-   Case selection: which countries, observation period, ...

    -   Theoretically justified!

    -   Address pragmatic trade-offs (e.g., limited survey period).

## Analysis

Test what you have previously described:

-   Model description and justification

-   Presentation and discussion of results (using tables, graphs)

    -   Focus on hypothesis(es). Briefly: control variables

-   (Robustness tests)

-   Brief summary: evidence for your hypothesis?

-   Interpretation, generalizability -\> more detailed in the conclusion

## Literature Review

-   Presents all relevant literature

-   Ignores all irrelevant(!) literature

-   Categorizes the existing literature and evaluates it fairly

-   Creates space for your own argument

-   Do not just list article after article!

## Structuring Literature Review

1.  Recapitulation of the primary phenomenon of interest.

2.  Naming and discussion of the literature's criteria for classification.

3.  The first argument represented in the literature

4.  The second argument represented in the literature

5.  \[...\]

6.  Highlight the research gap that you will address!

## Conclusion

-   Repeat research question, argument and result

-   Implications: Scientific, real-world, normative

-   Generalizability, limits of own work, and interpretation of results

-   Future research

## Introduction

-   What is the motivation of the work, why is it important to deal with it? What is the research question?

-   In a nutshell: Main argument and rationale.

-   In brief: how is the argument tested, what is the result? In what way does your work contribute?

    -   Important: scientific text is not a crime novel. You can/should 'spoil' here

-   Description of the remainder, what do you do in the next sections?

## Tables and Graphs (1)

-   Use publications in professional journals as a guide.

-   Label table and graphs and add captions! They should be understandable without further explanation by the text.

-   Explain and interpret tables and figures in your text.

    -   You must mention each table and figure at least once in the text (e.g., "Table 1 shows...", ...

-   Only use them if they add additional value.

## Tables and Graphs (2)

-   Do not just copy & paste tables or regression output from Stata or R. There are packages for this!

-   Make sure that all tables and graphs in the text have a consistent design

-   Use grayscale rather than color.

-   No 3D elements.
